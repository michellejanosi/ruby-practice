# Write a method named include? that takes an Array and a search value as arguments.
# This method should return true if the search value is in the array, false if it is not.
# You may not use the Array#include? method in your solution.

def include?(arr, item)
  arr.any? { |e| e == item }
end

include?([1,2,3,4,5], 3) # == true
include?([1,2,3,4,5], 6) # == false
include?([], 3) # == false
include?([nil], nil) # == true
include?([], nil) # == false
